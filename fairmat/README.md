Dear Sebastian and colleagues,

Please find the glossary and structure of the edaxh5 example. In our meeting we exchanged about the following next steps:
- [ ] Generate a table (e.g. using Excel) based on the CSV file to document what is what quantity, units etc.?
- [ ] Which fields would be most useful to include in a research data management system?

Bests,
Markus KÃ¼hbach
